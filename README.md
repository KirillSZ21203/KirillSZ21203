## Hi there, I'm Kirill Zhukov! ðŸ‘‹
### I started to learn Python at December 2024. Iâ€™m currently learning Python. At the moment, I know the basics of Python and Git. 
#### Iâ€™m currently working on a thesis where I use Python to model a sparse antenna array with a random arrangement of elements.
